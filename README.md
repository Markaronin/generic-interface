# Generic Interface

This is a generic interface that provides a starting point for a webapp that uses react, less, and a simple static file server.

To start the static server, run `yarn dev-server`

To start the webpack compiler, run `yarn dev-client`

To deploy this, you'll want to run `npx webpack` and deploy the `public` folder to a static server.
